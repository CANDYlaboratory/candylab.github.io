The <strong>C</strong>omputational and <strong>A</strong>dvanced <strong>N</strong>euroimaging of brain <strong>DY</strong>namics (<strong>CANDY</strong>) Lab is directed by [Dr. Jingyuan Chen](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/4258043), and affiliated with the [Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://www.martinos.org/) at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Our research program lies at the interface of biomedical engineering, signal processing, and neuroscience. We advance neuroimaging techniques (with an emphasis on functional PET-MRI and ultra-high-field fMRI) and computational approaches to study the biophysical and molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic brain activity, and the neurobiological consequences enacted by cognition, arousal, and disease.

Aloha! The CANDY lab has arrived! <br>

ðŸ’°ðŸ’° We are grateful to the NIH NINDS R00 award for funding our research! We will advance a functional PET-MRI framework to characterize the metabolic signatures of functional network behaviors across different arousal and cognitive states.  <br>  	

ðŸ’°ðŸ’° We are also grateful to the [Harvard Mind Brain Behavior Faculty Research Award](https://mbb.harvard.edu/pages/faculty-awards) and the [Brain & Behavior Research Foundation Young Investigator Grant](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/grants-prizes/bbrf-young-investigator-grants) for funding our research! We will apply simultaneous EEG-PET-MRI to study the mechanisms of cognitive deficits in Schizophrenia.
