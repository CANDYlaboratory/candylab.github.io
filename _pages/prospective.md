<strong> Postdoctoral fellows:</strong> We currently have one post-doctoral research fellow position in multi-modal neuroimaging of Aging and Alzheimerâ€™s disease jointly funded by an NIH T32 postdoctoral training grant and the BrightFocus Foundation Alzheimerâ€™s research grant. The position is open to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Please see this [ad]({{site.url}}/assets/PostDoc_MultiModal_Ad_T32_BrightFocus.pdf) for further information. If you have external funding resources or ideas for developing fellowship applications, please get in touch! <br>

**Ph.D. students:** We always seek graduate students with the passion to perform research at the interface of signal processing, brain imaging, and neuroscience. While we directly recruit graduate students from the [Medical Engineering and Medical Physics (MEMP) program](https://hst.mit.edu/applying-hst/applying-medical-engineering-and-medical-physics-memp-phd-program) at the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology Institute, we are also very interested in exploring opportunities with graduate students from other universities and departments in the Boston area. If you are interested in joining our group, please send your CV and transcripts to jechen at mgh.harvard.edu. <br>

**Undergraduate students:** We always welcome talented and motivated undergraduate students to learn about neuroimaging and carry out research in our lab! Please complete this [application form]({{site.url}}/assets/UndergradApplicationForm.pdf) and send it along with your CV to jechen at mgh.harvard.edu.  <br>

**â‰¤High school students:** If you love doodling and want to contribute to our effort in creating cartoons of medical imaging techniques, please send your CV and an art piece to jechen at mgh.harvard.edu. This will also be an excellent opportunity for you to learn the mechanisms and physics of a specific medical imaging modality. We welcome students from all around the world!
